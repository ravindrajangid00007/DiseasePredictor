Conduct Toward Myself

I will choose healthy snacks over processed snacks.

I will not put myself down for any reason.

I will leave work concerns at work and home concerns at home.

Conduct Toward Others

I will extend kindness to all others, even when they don’t extend it to me.

I will take action to help a person in need if I see their need and am capable of making the situation better.

I will respect differences of opinion by acknowledging the other person’s stance and not pushing their acceptance of mine.

Conduct in Difficult Situations

In a violent situation, I will only retaliate with violence if I am unable to call for or get to help.

If a disagreement turns into a negative argument, I will walk away from the situation.
